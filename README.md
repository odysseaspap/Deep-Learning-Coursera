# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
This repository contains my solutions for the 5-course specialization offered by Andrew Ng, [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)  

"The Deep Learning Specialization is designed to prepare learners
to participate in the development of cutting-edge AI technology,
and to understand the capability, the challenges, and the
consequences of the rise of deep learning. Through five
interconnected courses, learners develop a profound knowledge
of the hottest AI algorithms, mastering deep learning from its
foundations (neural networks) to its industry applications
(Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech
Recognition, etc.)."
